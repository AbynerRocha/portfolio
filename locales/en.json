        "description": "My name's Abyner Rocha, and I've been teaching myself programming since I was 9 years old. My journey started with Python, driven by curiosity, but I soon fell in love with web development using the classic trio: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\nOver the years, I gained experience working with PHP, and today my main focus is building modern and dynamic interfaces using ReactJS. Iâ€™m naturally curious and always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills to create even better solutions.",
